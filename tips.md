## Tips and tricks for a better looking taskbar

### Aero Peek Button

TranslucentTB has an option to hide it, resulting in a better appearance when on the desktop. It also offers a dynamic option, which allows to hide it only when there is no maximised window.

### Color

TranslucentTB's color picker offers live preview, so you can try a bunch of color options easily.

If the taskbar elements show up with a different coloring, make sure to turn off the accent color on the taskbar, under "Settings" > "Personalization" > "Colors".
