## Privacy Policy

Your use of this application consists in an agreement of this policy.

### Content of the privacy policy

This application doesn't:
- Collects & uses any personal information;
- Stores any personal data;
- Shares it to third parties.

All data required for operation, including but not limited to:
- The title of opened windows;
- The class of opened windows;
- The name of the processes having opened windows;

is treated for proper function of the application and never sent online. It is not stored on disk unless the user enabled verbose logging, but this log file is also not uploaded anywhere. It is used for voluntary and optional submission to the developer to help diagnose an issue.

If the application crashes during regular operation, normal Windows telemetry features might anonymously send such information to the developer, which will be used only for debugging and improvement of the application and will never be shared with third-parties. The developer also personally engages in acquiring such data only if required (for example, a crash impacting a vast range of users has been found) and deleting it from his drive as soon as possible.
