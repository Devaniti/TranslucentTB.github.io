## Privacy Policy

Your use of this application means you have reviewed this policy and agree to the terms therein.  
**Last updated:** July 8th, 2020


### Content of the privacy policy

This application doesn't:
- Collect or use any personal information;
- Store any personal data;
- Share it to third parties.

All data required for operation, including but not limited to:
- The title of opened windows;
- The class of opened windows;
- The name of the processes that have open windows;

is treated for proper function of the application and never sent online. It is not stored on disk unless the user enables verbose logging, but this log file is also not uploaded anywhere. It is used for voluntary and optional submission to the developer to help diagnose an issue.

If the application crashes during regular operation, normal Windows telemetry features might anonymously send such information to the developer, which will be used only for debugging and improvement of the application and will never be shared with third-parties. The developer will also personally engage in acquiring such data only if required (for example, a crash impacting a vast range of users has been found) and delete it from his drive as soon as possible.
